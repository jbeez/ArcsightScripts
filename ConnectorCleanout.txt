#example of how to cleanout a troubled connector. I recreated whatever was in it in other connectors, then I was able to run this to wipe out the cruft.
#using connector 3 in this example

/opt/local/monit/bin/monit stop connector_3
cd /opt/arcsight/connectors/connector_3
mkdir backup
mv agentupgrader.log backup
mv backupagentlauncher.log backup
mv connectorupgrade.progress.properties backup/
#this moves all the old versions into a backup folder(all these backup steps can prob be changed to deletions)
mv 7.* backup/
rm -rf /opt/arcsight/connectors/connector_3/current/temp/cwsapi_fileset_*
cd /opt/arcsight/connectors/connector_3/current/logs && rm -rf ThreadDump.* agent.log.* parseraupupgrader.log
cd /opt/arcsight/connectors/connector_3/current/user/agent && rm -rf upgrade_7.*.log upgrade.properties 3*.xml
cd /opt/arcsight/connectors/connector_3/user/agent/agentdata/ && rm -rf 3* ps.* TC_*
cd /opt/arcsight/connectors/ && /opt/local/monit/bin/monit start connector_3
